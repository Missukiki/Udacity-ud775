When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    It's important for teamwork.
    git remote (-v)
    git remote rm/rename
 Â   git remote add origin(repository_name) url

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    git push origin master(branch_name)
    git fetch origin (branch_name)
    git pull origin master(branch_name) 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork -- make a copy in Github, can edit in my own work space and push into my repository without change other's files.
    fork before clone
 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    origin/master <==> master
    pull = fetch + merge

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    using git and github is much easier.
    pull request

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    upstream
    con only figure out merge conflict in local work space.
