How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    That's really helpful to know where the differences are.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can easily remember what I am thinking before and it's more helpful for teamwork.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

    need mannual work
    more logical and less space

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Code is usually combined of several files,we need to save mutiple files in one commit;but it's kind of wasting of space.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Really cool!
    git config --global color.ui auto
    git log -- compare
    git diff file_ID1 file_ID2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    version-control can protect my file from dangerous changes,since I can access to early version at any time.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Everytime I start programming.
